# Introduction to Surge

The Surge network adopts a modular approach, leveraging the best practices
and lessons from other ecosystems. Inspired by the Cosmos modular design,
Surge enables decentralized proof validation, while CometBFT ensures Byzantine
Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus across the network, offering high performance
and security. The Surge Integration Kit empowers developers to integrate
Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and deploy secure rollups and dApps, inheriting
Bitcoin's robust security guarantees. This approach provides a reliable
foundation for Surge's key network components: Verifiers: Dedicated to
zk-proof verification, Surge Verifiers are integral in aggregating and
settling validated proofs on Bitcoin.

Integrated Signers: These handle transaction signing and manage distributed cryptographic keys, governing BTC vault operations with precision and reliability.

UTXO Indexers: Open to anyone, Indexers ensure transparent and seamless data retrieval, critical for enabling real-time audits across the network.
