# Verifiers

## Why do we need a verifier?

A verifier is essential in blockchain systems, especially in the context of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and complex transaction validation, because it ensures the correctness and integrity of data without exposing sensitive information. In the Surge Metalayer, a verifier plays a critical role by confirming that zk-proofs and other transactions submitted to the network are valid before they are aggregated and inscribed onto Bitcoin. This process guarantees that only legitimate, cryptographically proven transactions are finalized, enhancing the security and trust of the network.

Additionally, the verifier provides decentralization by allowing multiple participants in the network to independently check and validate proofs, preventing any single point of failure or malicious activity. In systems that aggregate multiple transactions or proofs, like Surge, the verifier also ensures scalability by efficiently handling large volumes of data while maintaining high standards of correctness.
However, the non-Turing-complete nature of Bitcoin's scripting language limits its proof verification capabilities. To address this, our Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) verifier network ensures that the submitted proofs are compatible, verifiable with BitVM2, and can be natively verified on the Bitcoin Layer.

## Building a PoS-Backed ZKP Verifier Network

We are developing an innovative Proof-of-Stake (PoS) based Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Verifier Network. This network is designed to ensure secure and efficient proof verification with the following key components and principles:

- ### Built on Cosmos SDK :

  Our ZKP Verifier Network is constructed using the Cosmos SDK, a powerful and modular framework that allows for the development of scalable and interoperable blockchain applications. By leveraging the Cosmos SDK, we ensure our network is both robust and adaptable to future advancements.

  <br />

- ### Proof Verification Modules

  We have developed specialized modules within the network that are responsible for verifying proofs generated using RISC Zero or SP1. These modules play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the network by ensuring that only valid proofs are processed and accepted.

  <br />

- ### Proof Aggregation
  Surge is building an in-network proof aggregation module to significantly improve cost-effectiveness and scalability. By aggregating multiple zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) into a single, compact proof, Surge minimizes the computational and storage overhead associated with verifying individual proofs on-chain. This approach reduces the gas fees and transaction costs required for submitting proofs to Bitcoin, making the process more efficient for participants. The proof aggregation module streamlines the validation of zk-proofs across Surge, enabling the network to handle larger volumes of transactions without compromising security or performance. By integrating this module directly into the Surge ecosystem, it ensures that proof verification remains cost-effective while maintaining the network's decentralized and secure architecture.

## Benefits of Our Approach

**Security**: By using the Bitcoin blockchain for final proof inscription, we harness its security features, ensuring the highest level of integrity for our proofs.

**Scalability**: The use of the Cosmos SDK allows for a scalable architecture, capable of handling a growing number of proofs and validators.

**Efficiency**: Our PoS mechanism and discrepancy challenge process ensure that the network operates efficiently, minimizing the chances of invalid proofs being accepted.

This approach combines the strengths of the Cosmos SDK, zero-knowledge proofs, staking on Babylon and Bitcoin's security to create a highly reliable, decentralized and secure verifier network.
