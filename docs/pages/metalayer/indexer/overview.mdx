# Utilities [Enhancing Rollup Functionality]

## Overview

The Surge Network integrates a specialized Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) Indexer to enhance transparency and facilitate efficient auditing, while achieving Bitcoin finality. This Indexer plays a critical role by systematically scanning Bitcoin blocks, specifically focusing on transactions tied to the Surge Network. It tracks UTXOs that contain unique Surge identifiers, ensuring seamless interaction between Surge and Bitcoin's blockchain.

Integration with Bitcoin Nodes
The UTXO Indexer is fully integrated with a Bitcoin node, allowing it to access real-time blockchain data. As new blocks are mined, the Indexer monitors these blocks, parsing through transactions to detect Surge-specific identifiers. These identifiers are embedded within transaction data, often found in OP_RETURN fields or encoded within the scriptPubKey. By filtering out irrelevant transactions, the Indexer ensures high performance and optimal resource utilization.

## Core Utilities

1. #### Native Stable Coins

   Integration with Union Protocol and Nobel, Plans are in place to introduce Native Stable Coins to Bitcoin Rollups from other ecosystems. This integration addresses the fragmentation of the protocol total value locked (TVL) and inherent liquidity challenges, thereby increasing interoperability between layer-2 ecosystems.

2. #### Oracles

   Oracles serve as data feeds that bring external information, such as market prices or environmental data, into the Rollups. This enables smart contracts to execute actions based on real-world events, greatly expanding the adaptability and applicability of decentralized applications (dApps).

3. #### Indexers

   Indexers organize and make blockchain data easily accessible.

4. #### Bridges for Runes and Ordinals

   This allows secure transfers and synchronization of assets like Runes and Ordinals between Bitcoin and rollups.

## Future Enhancements

**IBC Compatibility and Support:** Surge plans to integrate Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocols to enhance cross-chain interactions and functionalities.

**Expansion of Services:** The ongoing development of new tools and services will meet the evolving needs of the blockchain community and support emerging dApps and blockchain interactions.
