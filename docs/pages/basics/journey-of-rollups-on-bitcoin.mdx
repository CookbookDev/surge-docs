# Evolution of Rollups on Bitcoin [Unwrapping rollups one layer at a time]

Lets see the Bitcoin Roadmap from 2013 to Now,

ZK Rollups are a layer-2 scaling solution that perform transaction execution outside the main blockchain (layer-1) while maintaining data integrity and security through proofs.

**Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), Segregated Witness (SegWit), Blockchain Bridges** collectively lay the groundwork for implementing ZK Rollups on Bitcoin.

## Trust-Minimized Rollups

Lets Understand, How can we build a trust-minimised Rollup using ZK

### Main Limitations

- Bitcoin Cannot Verify the ZK Proof by Design

- UTXO Model Constraints - Validity on Multi Sig

## Bitcoin Rollups

BitVM whitepaper made things interesting by showing the ways for ZK proof verifications within the Bitcoin ecosystem with "1 / n trust assumptions", paving the way for enhanced scalability and security.

### Limitations

- Dishonest Sequencer

- Data Availability Layer

If Sequencer goes rogue, Shared Sequencer Can we be a one of the solution but data should be available, for which introducing Data availability layers is required

With Data Availability Layer,

## Inspiration from Validium, Sovereign Rollups

Data availability can be posted anywhere off chain for

- Cheaper Transactions

- Scalable Transactions

It can be posted on the any DA layers,

- Celestia DA

- Bitcoin DA

- Other DA Layers.

**Limitations with this,** How can they cross compose and share liquidity ?

But this can solved with the ZKPs which allows the Interactions with all the DA layers can be trustless allowing cross compute and shared liquidity

## Challenges in building Rollups on Bitcoin

Certainly! Here are the **five most important challenges** associated with building rollups on Bitcoin:

1. **Limited Smart Contract Capabilities**

   - **Simplistic Scripting Language:** Bitcoin’s scripting system is intentionally basic and lacks the flexibility found in platforms like Ethereum. This restricts the complexity and functionality required to implement sophisticated rollup mechanisms.
   - **No Native Turing-Completeness:** Without support for Turing-complete contracts, creating advanced Layer 2 solutions like rollups becomes significantly more challenging.

2. **Data Availability and Throughput Constraints**

   - **Block Size Limitations:** Bitcoin’s fixed block size and lower transaction throughput make it difficult to embed the large amounts of aggregated data that rollups require without increasing fees or block sizes.
   - **Scalability Bottlenecks:** The inherent scalability limits of Bitcoin can hinder the effectiveness of rollups, as the main chain may struggle to handle the volume of rollup data submissions.

3. **Alignment with Bitcoin’s Security and Consensus Model**

   - **Different Security Priorities:** Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism is optimized for security and decentralization rather than executing complex Layer 2 protocols. Ensuring that rollups maintain Bitcoin’s security standards without introducing vulnerabilities is a significant hurdle.
   - **Implementation of Fraud or Validity Proofs:** Mechanisms essential for rollup integrity, such as fraud proofs or validity proofs, are harder to implement within Bitcoin’s constrained scripting environment.

4. **Lack of Native Layer 2 Infrastructure and Support**

   - **Absence of Built-In Solutions:** Unlike Ethereum, which has a variety of established Layer 2 protocols, Bitcoin was not designed with Layer 2 scalability in mind. Developing the necessary infrastructure for rollups from scratch is both time-consuming and technically demanding.
   - **Interoperability Challenges:** Integrating rollups with Bitcoin’s existing ecosystem requires overcoming significant interoperability issues, as Bitcoin’s architecture is less modular compared to other blockchains.

5. **Limited Developer Tools and Ecosystem Support**
   - **Sparse Tooling and Libraries:** The Bitcoin ecosystem lacks the robust suite of developer tools, libraries, and frameworks that facilitate the creation and deployment of rollups, making development more arduous.
   - **Smaller Developer Community:** With fewer developers focused on advanced Layer 2 solutions for Bitcoin, innovation and problem-solving in this area progress more slowly compared to more actively developed platforms.

Building rollups on Bitcoin is hindered primarily by the blockchain’s limited smart contract functionality, data availability and throughput constraints, the need to align with Bitcoin’s robust security model, the absence of native Layer 2 infrastructure, and a less mature developer ecosystem. Overcoming these challenges requires significant innovation, enhanced tooling, and potentially future protocol enhancements to make sophisticated Layer 2 solutions like rollups feasible on the Bitcoin network.

This is where Surge comes in, aiming to address these obstacles by introducing zk-proofs capabilities, optimizing data throughput, and developing Layer 2 infrastructure tailored to Bitcoin’s security protocols. By providing robust developer tools and fostering a supportive ecosystem. Through these comprehensive solutions, Surge paves the way for scalable, secure, and efficient Layer 2 rollups, unlocking new potentials for Bitcoin’s scalability and functionality and driving broader adoption across diverse use cases.
